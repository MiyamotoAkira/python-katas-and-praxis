python-katas-and-praxis
=======================

Loose code for coding cata and programming praxis written in python


These are katas and praxis that I have/am using to learn Python.

tictactoe was my original python application. Developed on Pythonista for iPad and changed for uploading to GitHub, so it would run in a normal python installation.

eightqueens was originally developed on C# (my work language), first to finally tackle the problem (which I always said to myself "...one day"). And then it was rewritten in Python.

The rest I have been picking up from either Code Kata (http://codekata.pragprog.com/) or Programming Praxis (http://programmingpraxis.com/)
